go to "D:\Python_temp"

create a folder "MyPackage"

go to "MyPackage" folder

right click
	open folder as pycharm community folder


create "One.py"

def disp1():
    print("this is disp1 of One_py")


create "Two.py"

def disp2():
    print("this is disp2 of Two_py")


close the pycharm window.

now go to "This PC"
	right click
		properties
			Advanced system settings
				environment variables

	set pythonpath
		"D:\Python_temp"

now go to your normal working directory e.g.  "e:\\work"
	right click
		open folder as pycharm community folder

[ note:- it's very imp. to restart the pycharm window once you set "pythonpath" ]

create "First.py" where you would like to access "MyPackage" and invoke "disp1()" and "disp2()" of "One.py" and "Two.py" respectively.

	First.py

from MyPackage import One,Two      # to access "One.py" and "Two.py" modules

One.disp1()
Two.disp2()

	or

from MyPackage.One import *
from MyPackage.Two import *

disp1()
disp2()


Run this "First.py" to ensure that everything is working fine.
