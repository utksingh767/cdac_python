How can we create private and protected members in Python?

ans:-

You create private members by prefixing the member name with two leading underscores (__).

You create protected members by prefixing the member name with a single leading underscore (_).



class A:
    def __init__(self,a,b,c):
        self.a=a    # public
        self.__b=b  # private
        self._c=c   # protected

ref1=A(10,20,30)
print(ref1.a)
# print(ref1.b) # AttributeError: 'A' object has no attribute 'b'
# print(ref1.c) # AttributeError: 'A' object has no attribute 'c'
print(ref1._A__b)  # now it's possible
print(ref1._c)    #  # now it's possible
