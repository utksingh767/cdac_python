"""
When you write:

num = 100
num is a name (label) in the current namespace.

It refers to an int object 100 that lives in memory
(on the heap).

The integer 100 is an immutable object of type int.

"""

num=100
print(num)
del num
print(num)  # NameError: name 'num' is not defined

"""
when you do:

del num

You are removing the name "num" from the current namespace.

You are not deleting the int object itself, because:

Python uses reference counting and garbage collection.

If no other variable refers to that int object, 
it will be garbage collected.
