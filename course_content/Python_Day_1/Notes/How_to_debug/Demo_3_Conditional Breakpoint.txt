Given:

expense_list=[1230,2240,1500,1678,2020,1580,2240,1450,'1500',1245,2300]
total_expense=0

for expense in expense_list:
    total_expense+=expense

print("total expense is \t",total_expense)

when you run the above code, it will give you:

total_expense+=expense
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'int' and 'str'

This happened because one of the values inside the list is "string"

now you need to find out exactly where in the list that string value appears.
one way is to debug the way you do it normally , i.e.

place the breakpoint at "total_expense+=expense" statement 
and debug

on click of "step over" when values reaches to '1500' you can see exception. But for that you have to continuously click on "step over" option.

now say you have thousands of values in the list and you want to find out where exactly that first string appears because of which you get the exception and the worst part of it is that string value if it is available at the end of the list. Are you going to click on "step over" so many times?

certainly no. you don't want to waste time. 
for that you will go for "conditional breakpoint"

click on the left of "total_expense+=expense" 
	red dot will appear
		right click on it
	it will open a window where "condition" text box will appear
	
	in that text box, type following condition:
		type(expense)==str

	click on "done"
	now you will notice one more symbol of orange bulb on the left side of
				"total_expense+=expense"

	now right click on the editor where we write program
		debug <name of your python file>

what you will observe is , you can see the exception right away with the value '1500'. This saves your time. You don't have to click on "step over" continuously and waste your time.
