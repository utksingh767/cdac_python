As we know Python interpreter interprets statements from the first line of the python file ( .pyc file )

Suppose we write

def disp():
	print("hello")

now if we simply execute above file, there won't be any output.

but if we add following line:

disp()    # function call

and execute , we'll get the output.

Why it is so?



Simple. Python sees def disp():, and simply reads the function, without executing it. A call to any function in this disp() e.g. "print("hello") "  is just a string. It is not run yet, and it does not matter what it is and where it is defined - it is just text.

Only when python sees a function call, it starts executing the function and looks where functions are.
