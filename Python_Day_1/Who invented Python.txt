Guido van Rossum , a Dutch scientist

at Center for Mathematics and Research , Netherland

This person doesn't like C,C++ because of their syntax. He decided to make Python very simple, that's why we do not have {} and semicolon in Python.

The name Python is inspired from Guido's favourite comedy TV show called "Monty Python's Flying Circus".

Guido wanted a name that was short,unique and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.

 

He started Python language development as a hobby in 1989.

Python is inspired by the language ABC which itself a very simple programming language.

So we can say that Python's parent language is ABC language.

Python is very imp. for Data Analysis.
